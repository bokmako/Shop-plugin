## Notes
- As of right now the plugin is still in pre-release so all the features are not added yet and there might be some bugs or unusual things, if you do find them you can report them to this [discord](https://discord.gg/e465y7Xeba) where I(Maxthegreat) will be notified and try to fix them.
- I did not keep the russian version of the plugin and i am sorry for that, i shall add an option to use the plugin in russian in the configs in the release as well as make a russian readme.
- Note that [bokmako](https://github.com/bokmako) did an amazing work with this plugin and that it would have been hard for me to make what he did from scratch, most of the credits goes to them.
